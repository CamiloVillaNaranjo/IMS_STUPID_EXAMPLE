# IMS OOP DESIGN PATTERNS

This repo was created to explain with Code, two main principles OOD (Object Oriented Design patterns), that I prepared for IMS team at YUXI Global company.

## STUPID PROGRAMMING PARADIGM

- Singleton: is probably the most well-known design pattern, but also the most misunderstood one.

- Tight Coupling: also known as strong coupling, if we make a change in one module, requires to change another module.

- Untestability: Testing should not be hard! No, really. It could be caused by tight coupling.

- Premature Optimization: As said [Donald Knuth] "premature optimization is the root of all evil. There is only cost, and no benefit".

- Indesriptive Naming: It is related with naming conventions, remember that you're programming languages for humans, not for machines (IL does).

- Duplication: Duplicate code is bad, so please don't repeat yourself (DRY) and aplly KISS principle.
